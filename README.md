## Replay

**Replay - an online party application - first attempt at WebRTC**

###The Idea###
An online application for party planners to schedule party events, invite 
participants and hold party sessions which (ideally) are stored to be 
replayed later. During a session, the party planer can push web sites, 
and video to other participants.

This is a work in progress.

###Requirements###
1. Node.js 
2. Express
3. Socket.io
4. MongoDB or other JSON data store

###Running the application###
The application currently runs on port 9002. You can change this in app/app.js
